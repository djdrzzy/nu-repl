Included are any app specific automator actions and services that I have found handy.

There should be only one so far. It is used to highlight any text in any application
and then send the text to an existing nu-repl on some device. It looks for the file:

~/.nu-repl-location

for the address of the device on the same network and then sends the text over on
port 40005.

It's probably handy to assign a keyboard shortcut to it.

You'll need growl installed on your system as the automator action has a use for
that.
